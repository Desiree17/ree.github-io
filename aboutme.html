          <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
        <h2>Being a junior in high school, I never thought that I would get the opportunity to be working with a company called Scripted that taught me how to enhance my coding skills. Having experience with coding, for almost 5 years, I didn't realize that there was much more that I could learn; I couldnt've been more wrong. Taking coding classes has helped me shift into a more well-rounded person with one more talent to add to the list.</h2> 
        <h2>I also have a ton of hobbies such as crocheting/ knitting, baking, and volunteering. I love helping out in my community, and getting involved with the well being of other humans.</h2>
        <h2>Finally, I like to consider myself someone who is very outgoing, and someone who loves to have fun. I understand the fundamentals of life, and that there are times to be serious as well as times to kick back and relax. </h2>
